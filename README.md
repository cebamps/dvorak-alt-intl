# Dvorak alternative international no dead keys

This keyboard layout is included by default in unix distributions like `Debian`, and I really like it. I come from France, and it is useful for all french characters like `ç`, `à` or `é`. So I decided to export this layout to Mac OS and Windows. 

For now I've only exported french dead keys, your help is welcomed to complete this layout !

Tools used for building layout :

- Mac OS : Ukelele
- Windows : ?
